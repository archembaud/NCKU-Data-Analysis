# Tutorial A (2026)

Start with this data:

```python
testString = "  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The QUICK brown fox didn't jump today; instead, the fox napped! That $illy fox!  
Tags: animal, fox, quick, lazy, animal
Note:   This sentence contains repeated words, mixed CASE, extra   spaces, and punctuation.  "
```

Then, using the split(), replace(), count and other methods learned in class:

* Count how many times the word "fox" appears.

* Remove extra spaces from the sentences.

* Replace the $ character with s.

* Change QUICK to quick.

* Return the list of tags (animal, fox, quick, lazy) and print the tags to the screen (note - make sure the tags are not duplicated!)

Your python code should be named Tutorial_A.py and saved in the Class1 folder.
