# NCKU Introduction to Data Analysis - Datasets

This directory contains a few interesting datasets for the NCKU course on data analysis. These include real datasets - taken from experiments and observations - and generated (i.e. fake) datasets containing information that is realistic (in a way) but was programmatically generated.

## Description of this data and its contents

* The Generation folder contains python scripts to generate datasets.
* There are a number of CWA (Central Weather Administration, of Taiwan) files containing details of the history of a number of earthquakes in and around Taiwan.
* iris.data: This is the Iris data set, downloaded from the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).
* LargeSet and SmallSet - generated from a script in the /Generation folder, these contain groups of CSV files useful for loading into multiple dataframes.
